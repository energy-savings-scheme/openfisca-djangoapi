## Serving Locally and Deploying

#### Serving locally
This repo can be served in two ways:
1) Serve with a local development environment :heavy_check_mark:
   - Instructions in [local_deployment.md](docs/local_deployment.md)
2) Serve with Docker
   - Not recommended (this functionality is currently broken :warning:) :warning:
   - Instructions in [docker_deployment.md](docs/docker_deployment.md) 


#### Deploying
- This app can be deployed in a number of ways, we'll leave that up to you :wink:
- But, here are some considerations
   - This app uses a sqlite3 database. SQLite runs in memory, and backs up its data store in files on disk. Thus, a persistent filesystem is required - and platforms with ephemeral filesystems (such as Heroku) are not suitable.
 

## Serve with a local development environment (recommended)
